# Closed-Form Finite Recurrences for SU(2) 3nj Symbols

This repository contains materials related to the research paper "Closed-Form Finite Recurrences for SU(2) 3nj Symbols" by Arcticoder.

## Abstract

Building on the universal closed-form hypergeometric representation of SU(2) 3nj symbols, this work presents a finite set of algebraic three-term recurrence relations in the spin labels, together with minimal boundary data, which uniquely determine any SU(2) 3nj recoupling coefficient. These recurrences allow computation of all 3nj symbols in closed form without nested sums of 6j symbols.
